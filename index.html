        <li><strong>Technology Adoption & Performance Monitoring – Proactive Optimization & Developer Training:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Led the team in creating a proactive performance monitoring process, ensuring that optimization and 
                    remediation became a preventative measure rather than a reactive response to issues.</li>
                <li>Established a structured approach for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, improving system 
                    stability and minimizing downtime.</li>
                <li>Mentored junior developers by embedding performance monitoring best practices as a foundational skill, 
                    ensuring they understood how and when to integrate monitoring tools like LogRocket and Dynatrace.</li>  
                    How solutions like AWS S3, and CDNs could be introduced into the ecosystem to further improve performance
                    and scalability.</li>
                <li>Developed a process framework that ensured performance tracking and remediation became an integral part 
                    of software development and the product life cycle, reducing post-release incidents and support costs.</li>
                <li>Led performance optimizations, resolving bottlenecks in core ERP applications and improving load times
                    by 20%.</li>
